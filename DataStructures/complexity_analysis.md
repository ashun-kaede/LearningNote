# Complexity Analysis
## Big-O notation
Big-O notation gives an upper bound of the complexity in the WORST case, helping to quantify performance as the input size becomes arbitrarily large. 

- Constant Time: O(1)
- Logarithmic Time: O(log(n))
- Linear Time: O(n)
- Linearithmic Time: O(nlog(n))
- Quadric Time: O(n^2)
- Cubic Time: O(n^3)
- Exponential Time: O(b^n), b>1
- Factorial Time: O(n!)

## Exmple

```pascal=
i := 0
While i<n Do
    i = i + 1

//f(n) = n
//O(f(n)) = O(n)
```
